# Atomic-Orbitals-Visualizer
This project allows users to utilize Python to visualize the atomic orbitals of the hydrogen atom as 3-D volumetric density plots. This project is developed by Dr. Matthew D. Hanson for the purpose of helping students to better understand the nature of the atomic orbitals, the relationships between the quantum numbers and the nodal surfaces in the wavefunctions, and the relationship between the complex solutions to the Schrodinger equation and their real representations. This software may be utilized by anyone, though Dr. Hanson's original paper introducing this visualizer must be cited if this tool is used for other publications to the scientific literature, books, etc.
